// Given an integer array A of size N, find the first repeating element in it. We need to find the element that occurs more than once and whose index of first occurrence is smallest.
// If there is no repeating element, return -1.

// Input 1:  A = [10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6]
// Input 2:  A = [6, 10, 5, 4, 9, 120]

// Output 1: 5
// Output 2: -1
